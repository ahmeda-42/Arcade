**Personal project | Java | 2023**

My first personal CS project — a collection of terminal-based games built entirely in Java. Includes games like Hangman, a math quiz, Rock Paper Scissors, and my own version of Minecraft ("Minecraft 2.0"). 

This project was an early learning experience that helped me practice Java programming, game logic, and object-oriented design. While simple, I put a lot of time and effort into it and I’m proud of how much I learned.

## Features
- Multiple playable games in the terminal
- Custom version of Minecraft
- Practiced object-oriented programming and game logic

## How to run
Compile and run in your terminal:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
